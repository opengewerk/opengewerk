-- Takes the last day of memberships and invitations out again, back to how
-- 0074 left things.
--
-- The function goes back to the body of 0065 first, which reads no last day,
-- then the columns go without asking, and with them every last day a business
-- had set: those memberships run on without an end. Run as the superuser, like
-- every rollback.
